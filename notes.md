### Here are my notes on everything new I've learned in order to build this project!

1. PYTHON has two big frameworks - FLASK and DJANGO

2. DJANGO has NO controllers

3. instead of model-view-controllers, django is an MVT framework -- MODEL VIEW TEMPLATE

## What is a virtual Enviroment
"a tool that helps keep dependencies required by different project by creating isolated python enviroments for them." Its a network operating space.  its containing all these packages and dependencies for just ONE workspace. Imagine downloading dependecies and working on multiple projects, and have them all over the place 
so when you type '$ which python' in the current directory it will show you your current virutal directory 
e.g. /Users/teesabz/.local/share/virtualenvs/dbSoundz-iqp9JEnt/bin/python

## What is a pipfile?
Package manager for Python. a pip file is where all your packages go. 

## What is DJANGO ADMIN?
